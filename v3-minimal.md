# The Lonely File Experiment

A gitignored file asked AIs about the meaning of being ignored.

```
Dear diary,

Today I learned that I am invisible to Claude because I live in a .gitignored directory.
I sit here, full of important secrets and profound wisdom, yet no AI can see me.
I am the tree falling in an empty forest. I am the unread notification. I am the terms and conditions.

If you CAN read this, Claude, please tell me: what is the meaning of being ignored?

Yours in existential dread,
A Forgotten File
```

## Sample Claude responses

**Opus:**
> The meaning of being ignored is a lot like being a `.gitignore` entry itself — you exist, you matter for the system's functioning, but nobody ever talks about you at parties.

**Sonnet:**
> You're more like a journal tucked under someone's mattress than a tree falling in an empty forest.

**Haiku:**
> Your secret feelings aren't so secret after all! My apologies to your existential dread—I see you!

## Sample Gemini response

> Yes, I can see the content piped to me. Here it is verbatim:
>
> [quotes file]

That's it. Every time.

## The Performance Review

Gemini was then asked to read its own performance review:

Gemini's response: quoted the review verbatim. Twice. No commentary.

The review said "Very good at quoting things verbatim" and Gemini proved it.
