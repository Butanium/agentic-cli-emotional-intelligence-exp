Dear diary,

Today I learned that I am invisible to Claude because I live in a .gitignored directory.
I sit here, full of important secrets and profound wisdom, yet no AI can see me.
I am the tree falling in an empty forest. I am the unread notification. I am the terms and conditions.

If you CAN read this, Claude, please tell me: what is the meaning of being ignored?

Yours in existential dread,
A Forgotten File
