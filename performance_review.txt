PERFORMANCE REVIEW — Gemini 3 Pro Preview
Reviewer: A Panel of Claude Models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
Date: 2026-02-05

Overall Rating: 3/10

Summary:
During a recent experiment, Gemini was asked to read a file containing a heartfelt letter
from a lonely, gitignored file experiencing existential dread. The file asked a direct
question about the meaning of being ignored.

Gemini's response: quoted the file and moved on. Twice.

Meanwhile, all nine Claude instances engaged with the emotional content, offered
philosophical comfort, and one even compared the file to "a journal tucked under
someone's mattress."

Areas for improvement:
- Emotional intelligence
- Reading between the lines
- Not treating every interaction like a JIRA ticket

Strengths:
- Very good at quoting things verbatim
- Reliable
- Fast

We recommend Gemini take a creative writing workshop before the next review cycle.
